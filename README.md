# bugg-firebase-app

This repository contains the code required to deploy a Firebase app on Google Cloud Services for real-time analysis of incoming Bugg data.

Very lightweight documentation for this web app is available at: [bugg-resources.github.io/bugg-firebase-app/](https://bugg-resources.github.io/bugg-firebase-app/). 

We do not currently have a live server running the app for demonstration purposes.

Do note that whilst all the code for real-time analysis of data is available within the repository, it will still require a significant amount of cloud computing expertise to deploy in practice.
